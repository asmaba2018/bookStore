    <h2>Science Fiction</h2>
        <h3>The War of The Worlds</h3>
            <p>
                In this alien novel, a group of Martians invades Earth, everything in 
                <br>their path and terrorizing humans who are forced to reckon with the 
                <br>fact that the world may truly be ending. When the novel was first 
                <br>turned into a radio broadcast in 1938, it was so thrilling and realistic; 
                <br>it actually caused public panic as many listeners didn't realize it was fiction.

        <h3>Starship Troopers</h3>
            <p>
                Overtly glorifying the military, the book follows a group of men as they 
                <br>endure the most difficult training in the universe before setting off 
                <br>to fight a species of aliens in the Bug War. While readers may not 
                <br>agree with all of the viewpoints presented in the novel's 300 pages, 
                <br>it's still an important read in the science fiction canon.
